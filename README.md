## Projects:
### One Ring to Rule Them All
A simple web application to play around with the API @ https://the-one-api.dev/. 

### JS Form Validation
Project sample to learn different JS Form validation techniques

### Calendar App
Calendar app built using Node.js. I built this application to learn Express, EJS, and Node.js. 
Additionally, I hosted this site on a raspberry pi and set up the repository to auto deploy so that I could work on it from a different machine. 
An image showing this off can be found in the images folder.

### ROR2 Mod
This is a cheesy mod I made in a video game called Risk of Rain 2. The game was built in C# Unity and the mod is just a simple C# class that hooks onto different processes in the game.
In my mod, when you kill an enemy, another one will immediately spawn where at the player's position. A video can be found in the images folder.

### DotNetCore
This was a class project created as a .NET EF Core MVC Application. It is heavily based on the tutorial from Microsoft https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/data/ef-mvc/crud?view=aspnetcore-6.0 

### LargeCo DB
I built a web application using a database that came with a class textbook for an imaginary company called "LargeCo". 
I wrote the application in Node.JS, express, and EJS like the Calendar app. The database used was MYSQL hosted on a raspberry pi.

### Project2
I built a small procedurally generated "game" in C# using the monogame framework. Simplex noise generates the pseudo random noise that creates the world. The player is a white square that can move around and the world will generate as you move into unexplored areas.
An image can be found in the images folder.
